\section{Some implementation notes}
All of the implementation can be found here:


$ https://github.com/RoeiBrudo/Explainability_GAN $

the data could be found here:

$ https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rBQXD5mZv4ed1--XsmMig36oh0-70Kp2/view?usp=sharing $

All that is needed is to extract the data folder to the explainabilityMain folder, and to run $ main.py $ script.

The script arguments:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c }
 function & GAN or CGAN or InfoGAN  \\ 
 data & MNIST or IAM   \\  
 action & train or infer \\
 explore latent & flag \\
 explore attention  & flag   
   
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


The only exception is the discovery of latent space direction on ScrabbleGAN, which gave the best results when used in an off the shelve solution by Nikolai10:

The solution for that algorithm is ScrabbleDirections folder. all is needed it to train the model first $ main.py $ and then run the $ run_explorer.py $  script.
